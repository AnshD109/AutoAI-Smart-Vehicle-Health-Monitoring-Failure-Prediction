# AutoAI-Smart-Vehicle-Health-Monitoring-Failure-Prediction
Developed in January 2025, AutoAI is a smart vehicle health monitoring and failure prediction system. It leverages real-time sensor data and machine learning (XGBoost) to detect potential faults before they happen. With MQTT-based streaming and a Flask dashboard, it brings AI and IoT together for safer, data-driven vehicle diagnostics.
